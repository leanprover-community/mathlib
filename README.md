[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/mathlib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/mathlib)

Lean standard library

Besides [Lean's general documentation](https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/), the documentation of mathlib consists of:
* a description of [currently covered theories](docs/theories.md)
* an explanation of [naming conventions](docs/naming.md) that is useful
  to find or contribute definitions and lemmas
* a description of [tactics](docs/tactics.md) introduced in mathlib
* a [style guide](docs/style.md) for contributors
* a tentative list of [work in progress](docs/wip.md) to make sure
  efforts are not duplicated without collaboration
