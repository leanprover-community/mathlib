# Topological lattices

In this file we define mixin classes `has_continuous_inf` and `has_continuous_sup`. We define the
class `topological_lattice` as a topological space and lattice `L` extending `has_continuous_inf`
and `has_continuous_sup`.

Let `L` be a topological space and let `L×L` be equipped with the product topology and let
`⊓:L×L → L` be an infimum. Then `L` is said to have *(jointly) continuous infimum* if the map
`⊓:L×L → L` is continuous.

Let `L` be a topological space and let `L×L` be equipped with the product topology and let
`⊓:L×L → L` be a supremum. Then `L` is said to have *(jointly) continuous supremum* if the map
`⊓:L×L → L` is continuous.

Let `L` be a topological space with a supremum. If the order dual has a continuous infimum then the
supremum is continuous.

Let `L` be a lattice equipped with a topology such that `L` has continuous infimum and supremum.
Then `L` is said to be a *topological lattice*.
