# Sheaf conditions for presheaves of (continuous) functions.

We show that
* `Top.sheaf_condition.to_Type`: not-necessarily-continuous functions into a type form a sheaf
* `Top.sheaf_condition.to_Types`: in fact, these may be dependent functions into a type family

For
* `Top.sheaf_condition.to_Top`: continuous functions into a topological space form a sheaf
please see `topology/sheaves/local_predicate.lean`, where we set up a general framework
for constructing sub(pre)sheaves of the sheaf of dependent functions.

## Future work
Obviously there's more to do:
* sections of a fiber bundle
* various classes of smooth and structure preserving functions
* functions into spaces with algebraic structure, which the sections inherit

We show that the presheaf of functions to a type `T`
(no continuity assumptions, just plain functions)
form a sheaf.

In fact, the proof is identical when we do this for dependent functions to a type family `T`,
so we do the more general case.

    -- `s`, some cone over the sheaf condition diagram
    -- (which we can think of as some type `s.X` which we know nothing about,
    -- except how to restrict terms to each of the `U i`, obtaining a function there,
    -- and that these restrictions are compatible), and
    -- `f`, a term of `s.X`.
    -- We do this one point at a time, so we also pick some `x` and the evidence `mem : x ∈ supr U`.

    -- We define out function to be the restriction of `f` to that `U i`, evaluated at `x`.

  { -- Now we need to verify that this lifted function restricts correctly to each set `U i`.
    -- Of course, the difficulty is that at any given point `x ∈ U i`,
    -- we may have used the axiom of choice to pick a differnt `j` with `x ∈ U j`
    -- when defining the function.
    -- This we'll need to use the fact that the restrictions are compatible.

    -- Again, we begin with some `s`, a cone over the sheaf condition diagram.
    intros s,
    -- The goal at this point is fairly inscrutable,
    -- but we know we're trying two functions are equal, so we call `ext` and see what we get:
    ext i f ⟨x, mem⟩,
    dsimp at mem,
    -- We now have `i : ι`, a term `f : s.X`, and a point `x` with `mem : x ∈ U i`.

    -- We clean up the goal a little,
    simp only [exists_prop, set.mem_range, set.mem_image, exists_exists_eq_and, category.assoc],
    simp only [limit.lift_π, types_comp_apply, fan.mk_π_app, presheaf_to_Type],
    dsimp,
    -- although you still need to be ambitious to read it.
    -- The mathematical content, of course, is that the lifted function we constructed from `f`,
    -- when restricted to `U i` and evaluated at `x`,
    -- has the same value as `f` restricted to to `U i` and evaluated at `x`.

    -- We have a slightly annoying issue at this point,
    -- that we're not really sure which `j : ι` was used to define the lifted function
    -- and this point `x`, because we used choice.
    -- As a trick, we create a new metavariable `j` to represent this choice,
    -- and later in the proof it will be solved by unification.
    let j : ι := _,

      -- because Lean's unification has worked out that this `j` must have been the index
      -- that we picked using choice back when constructing the lift.
      -- From this, we can extract the evidence that `x ∈ U j`:
      convert @classical.some_spec _ (λ i, x ∈ (U i : set X)) _, },

    -- and do a little patching up afterwards.

  { -- On the home stretch now,
    -- we just need to check that the lift we picked was the only possible one.

    -- So we suppose we had some other way `m` of choosing lifts,

    -- for each `f : s .X` and each `x ∈ supr U`.
