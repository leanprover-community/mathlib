# Topological (sub)algebras

A topological algebra over a topological ring `R` is a
topological ring with a compatible continuous scalar multiplication by elements of `R`.

## Results

This is just a minimal stub for now!

The topological closure of a subalgebra is still a subalgebra,
which as an algebra is a topological algebra.
