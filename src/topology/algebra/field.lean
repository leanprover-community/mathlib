We don't have a separate typeclass for topological fields:
it's enough to have `{𝕜 : Type*} [field 𝕜] [topological_space 𝕜] [topological_ring 𝕜]`.

This file contains a construction that uses these typeclasses,
and otherwise doesn't have a good home where its dependencies are available.

variables {𝕜 : Type*} [field 𝕜] [topological_space 𝕜] [topological_ring 𝕜]

/--
The map `λ x, a * x + b`, as a homeomorphism from `𝕜` (a topological field) to itself, when `a ≠ 0`.
