### Algebra structure

In this section we show that continuous functions valued in a topological algebra `A` over a ring
`R` inherit the structure of an algebra. Note that the hypothesis that `A` is a topological algebra is
obtained by requiring that `A` be both a `topological_semimodule` and a `topological_semiring`
(by now we require `topological_ring`: see TODO below).-/

  map_zero' := by ext x; exact (algebra_map R A).map_zero,
  map_add'  := λ c₁ c₂, by ext x; exact (algebra_map R A).map_add _ _ }

  smul_def' := λ c f, by ext x; exact algebra.smul_def' _ _,
  ..continuous_semimodule,
  ..continuous_ring }

/- TODO: We are assuming `A` to be a ring and not a semiring just because there is not yet an
instance of semiring. In turn, we do not want to define yet an instance of semiring because there is
no `is_subsemiring` but only `subsemiring`, and it will make sense to change this when the whole
file will have no more `is_subobject`s but only `subobject`s. It does not make sense to change
it yet in this direction as `subring` does not exist yet, so everything is being blocked by
`subring`: afterwards everything will need to be updated to the new conventions of Mathlib.
Then the instance of `topological_ring` can also be removed. -/

### Structure as module over scalar functions

If `M` is a module over `R`, then we show that the space of continuous functions from `α` to `M`
is naturally a module over the algebra of continuous functions from `α` to `M`. -/
