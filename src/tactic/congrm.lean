/-! `congrm`: `congr` with pattern-matching

`congrm e` gives to the use the functionality of using `congr` with an expression `e` "guiding"
`congr` through the matching.  This allows more flexibility than `congr' n`, which enters uniformly
through `n` iterations.  Instead, we can guide the matching deeper on some parts of the expression
and stop earlier on other parts.

For each element of `list congr_arg_kind` that is `eq`, add a pair `(g, pat)` to the
final list.  Otherwise, discard an appropriate number of initial terms from each list
(possibly none from the first) and repeat.

`pat` is the given pattern-piece at the appropriate location, extracted from the last `list expr`.
It appears to be the list of arguments of a function application.

`g` is possibly the proof of an equality?  It is extracted from the first `list expr`.

`equate_with_pattern_core pat` solves a single goal of the form `lhs = rhs`
(assuming that `lhs` and `rhs` are unifiable with `pat`)
by applying congruence lemmas until `pat` is a metavariable.
Returns the list of metavariables for the new subgoals at the leafs.
Calls `set_goals []` at the end.

`congrm e` assumes that the goal is of the form `lhs = rhs` or `lhs ↔ rhs`.
`congrm e` scans `e, lhs, rhs` in parallel.
Assuming that the three expressions are successions of function applications, lambdas or pis,
`congrm e` uses `e` as a pattern to decide what to do in corresponding places of `lhs` and `rhs`.

If `e` has a meta-variable in a location, then the tactic produces a side-goal with
the equality of the corresponding locations in `lhs, rhs`.

If `e` is a function application, `congrm` applies the automatically generated congruence lemma
(like `tactic.congr`).

If `e` is a lambda abstraction, `congrm` applies `funext`.
If `e` is a pi, `congrm` applies `pi_congr`.

Subexpressions that are defeq or whose type is a subsingleton are skipped.
