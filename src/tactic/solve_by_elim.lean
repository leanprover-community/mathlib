`apply_assumption` looks for an assumption of the form `... → ∀ _, ... → head`
where `head` matches the current goal.

alternatively, when encountering an assumption of the form `sg₀ → ¬ sg₁`,
after the main approach failed, the goal is dismissed and `sg₀` and `sg₁`
are made into the new goal.

optional arguments:
- asms: list of rules to consider instead of the local constants
- tac:  a tactic to run on each subgoals after applying an assumption; if
        this tactic fails, the corresponding assumption will be rejected and
        the next one will be attempted.

`solve_by_elim` calls `apply_assumption` on the main goal to find an assumption whose head matches
and then repeatedly calls `apply_assumption` on the generated subgoals until no subgoals remain,
performing at most `max_rep` recursive steps.

`solve_by_elim` discharges the current goal or fails

`solve_by_elim` performs back-tracking if `apply_assumption` chooses an unproductive assumption

By default, the assumptions passed to apply_assumption are the local context, `congr_fun` and
`congr_arg`.

`solve_by_elim [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` also applies the named lemmas.

`solve_by_elim with attr₁ ... attrᵣ also applied all lemmas tagged with the specified attributes.

`solve_by_elim only [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` does not include the local context, `congr_fun`, or `congr_arg`
unless they are explicitly included.

`solve_by_elim [-id]` removes a specified assumption.

`solve_by_elim*` tries to solve all goals together, using backtracking if a solution for one goal
makes other goals impossible.

optional arguments:
- discharger: a subsidiary tactic to try at each step (e.g. `cc` may be helpful)
- max_rep: number of attempts at discharging generated sub-goals
