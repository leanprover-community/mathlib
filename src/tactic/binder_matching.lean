# Matching expressions with leading binders

This module defines a family of tactics for matching expressions with leading Π
or λ binders, similar to Core's `mk_local_pis`. They all iterate over an
expression, processing one leading binder at a time. The bound variable is
replaced by either a fresh local constant or a fresh metavariable in the binder
body, 'opening' the binder. We then recurse into this new body. This scheme is
implemented by `tactic.mk_binder`.

Based on `mk_binder`, we define many variations of this recipe:

- `mk_local_{pis,lambdas}` opens all leading Π/λ binders and replaces them with
  fresh local constants. Example:

  ```
  mk_local_lambdas `(λ (x : X) (y : Y), f x y) =
    ([`(_fresh.1), `(_fresh.2)], `(f _fresh.1 _fresh.2))
  ```

  `_fresh.1` and `_fresh.2` are fresh local constants (with types `X` and `Y`,
  respectively). The second component of the pair is the lambda body with
  `x` replaced by `_fresh.1` and `y` replaced by `_fresh.2`.
- `mk_meta_{pis,lambdas}` opens all leading Π/λ binders and replaces them with
  fresh metavariables.
- `mk_{local,meta}_{pis,lambdas}n` opens only the first `n` leading binders.
  These functions fail if there are not at least `n` leading binders. Example:

  ```
  mk_local_pisn `(Π (x : X) (y : Y), P x y) 1 =
    ([`(_fresh.1)], `(Π (y : Y), P _fresh.1 y))
  ```
- `mk_{local,meta}_{pis,lambdas}[n]_whnf` normalises the input expression each
  time before trying to match a binder. Example:

  ```
  mk_local_lambdas_whnf `(let f := λ (x : X), g x y in f) =
    ([`(_fresh.1)], `(g _fresh.1 y))
  ```
- `tactic.get_pi_binders` and `tactic.get_pi_binders_nondep` are more
  specialised instances of `mk_binder`.

The `mk_local_*` functions are commonly used like this:

1. Open (some of) the binders of an expression `e`, producing local constants
   `lcs` and the 'body' `e'` of `e`.
2. Process `e'` in some way.
3. Reconstruct the binders using `tactic.pis` or `tactic.lambdas`, which
   Π/λ-bind the `lcs` in `e'`.

`mk_binders` implements the common functionality of functions like
`get_pi_binders` and `mk_meta_pis`. It proceeds as follows:

1. Match a pi or lambda binder using `match_binder`. `match_binder` should
   return the name, binder_info, type and body of a leading binder.
   Stop if this returns `none`.
2. Use `binder_replacement` to constructs a replacement for this binder (in
   our applications either a local constant or a metavariable) and instantiate
   the bound variable with this replacement in the binder body.
3. Use `result` to construct a result.
4. Recurse into the binder body.

`mk_binders` returns the list of results and the rest of the expression (with
previously bound variables instantiated with their replacements).

`binder_replacement` and `result` receive the binder information returned by
`match_binder`. `match_binder` and `result` also receive the current recursion
depth.

If `match_binder`, `binder_replacement` or `result` fail at any point, the whole
tactic fails.
