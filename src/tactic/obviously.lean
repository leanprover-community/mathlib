`sorry_if_contains_sorry` will solve any goal already containing `sorry` in its type with `sorry`,
and fail otherwise.

The propositional fields of `category` are annotated with the auto_param `obviously`,
which is defined here as a
[`replacer` tactic](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/commands.html#def_replacer).
We then immediately set up `obviously` to call `tidy`. Later, this can be replaced with more
powerful tactics.

(In fact, at present this mechanism is not actually used, and the implementation of
`obviously` below stays in place throughout mathlib.)

The default implementation of `obviously`
discharges any goals which contain `sorry` in their type using `sorry`,
and then calls `tidy`.

tactic.sorry_if_contains_sorry <|>
tactic.tidy <|>
tactic.fail (
"`obviously` failed to solve a subgoal.\n" ++
"You may need to explicitly provide a proof of the corresponding structure field.")
