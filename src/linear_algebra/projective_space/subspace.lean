# Subspaces of Projective Space

In this file we define subspaces of a projective space, and show that the subspaces of a projective
space form a complete lattice under inclusion.

## Implementation Details

A subspace of a projective space ℙ K V is defined to be a structure consisting of a subset of
ℙ K V such that if two nonzero vectors in V determine points in ℙ K V which are in the subset, and
the sum of the two vectors is nonzero, then the point determined by the sum of the two vectors is
also in the subset.

## Results

- There is a Galois insertion between the subsets of points of a projective space
  and the subspaces of the projective space, which is given by taking the span of the set of points.
- The subspaces of a projective space form a complete lattice under inclusion.

# Future Work
- Show that there is a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence between subspaces of a
  projective space and the submodules of the underlying vector space.
