# Non-functorial cohomology groups for cochain complexes

We setup that part of the theory of cohomology groups which works in
any category with kernels and images.

We define the cohomology groups themselves, and while we can show that
chain maps induce maps on the kernels, at this level of generality
chain maps do not induce maps on the images, and so not on the cohomology groups.

We'll do this with stronger assumptions, later.

At this point we assume that we have all images, and all equalizers.
We need to assume all equalizers, not just kernels, so that
`factor_thru_image` is an epimorphism.

-- TODO (a good project!):

-- Let's add these later, with appropriate (but hopefully fairly minimal)

-- i.e. the coequalizer of the kernel pair,
