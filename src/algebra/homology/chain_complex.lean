# Chain complexes

We define a chain complex in `V` as a differential `‚Ñ§`-graded object in `V`.

This is fancy language for the obvious definition,
and it seems we can use it straightforwardly:

```
example (C : chain_complex V) : C.X 5 ‚ü∂ C.X 6 := C.d 5
```

We define the forgetful functor to `‚Ñ§`-graded objects, and show that
`chain_complex V` is concrete when `V` is, and `V` has coproducts.

-- `chain_complex V` is also enriched in W?

-- TODO `chain_complex V` is a module category for `V` when `V` is monoidal

-- TODO When V is enriched in AddCommGroup, and has coproducts,
-- we can collapse a double complex to obtain a complex.
-- If the double complex is supported in a quadrant, we only need finite coproducts.

-- TODO when V is monoidal, enriched in `AddCommGroup`,
-- and has coproducts then
-- `chain_complex V` is monoidal too.
-- If the complexes are bounded below we only need finite coproducts.
