# Algebraic quotients

This file defines notation for algebraic quotients, e.g. quotient groups `G /// H`,
quotient modules `M /// N` and ideal quotients `R /// I`.

## Notations

The following notation is introduced:

* `G /// H` stands for the quotient of the type `G` by the `set_like` element H

## Tags
