/-- The type of objects of the opposite of `α`; used to defined opposite category/group/...

  In order to avoid confusion between `α` and its opposite type, we
  set up the type of objects `opposite α` using the following pattern,
  which will be repeated later for the morphisms.

  1. Define `opposite α := α`.
  2. Define the isomorphisms `op : α → opposite α`, `unop : opposite α → α`.
  3. Make the definition `opposite` irreducible.

  This has the following consequences.

  * `opposite α` and `α` are distinct types in the elaborator, so you
    must use `op` and `unop` explicitly to convert between them.
  * Both `unop (op X) = X` and `op (unop X) = X` are definitional
    equalities. Notably, every object of the opposite category is
    definitionally of the form `op X`, which greatly simplifies the
    definition of the structure of the opposite category, for example.

  (If Lean supported definitional eta equality for records, we could
  achieve the same goals using a structure with one field.)
