# Symmetric powers

This file defines symmetric powers of a type.  The nth symmetric power
consists of homogeneous n-tuples modulo permutations by the symmetric
group.

The special case of 2-tuples is called the symmetric square, which is
addressed in more detail in `data.sym2`.

TODO: This was created as supporting material for `data.sym2`; it
needs a fleshed-out interface.

/--
The nth symmetric power is n-tuples up to permutation.  We define it
as a subtype of `multiset` since these are well developed in the
library.  We also give a definition `sym.sym'` in terms of vectors, and we
show these are equivalent in `sym.sym_equiv_sym'`.

def sym (α : Type*) (n : ℕ) := {s : multiset α // s.card = n}

/--
This is the `list.perm` setoid lifted to `vector`.

def vector.perm.is_setoid (α : Type*) (n : ℕ) : setoid (vector α n) :=
{ r := λ a b, list.perm a.1 b.1,
  iseqv := by { rcases list.perm.eqv α with ⟨hr, hs, ht⟩, tidy, } }

Another definition of the nth symmetric power, using vectors modulo permutations. (See `sym`.)

def sym' (α : Type*) (n : ℕ) := quotient (vector.perm.is_setoid α n)

/--
Multisets of cardinality n are equivalent to length-n vectors up to permutations.
