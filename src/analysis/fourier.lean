# Fourier analysis on the circle

This file contains some first steps towards Fourier series.

## Main definitions

* `haar_circle`, Haar measure on the circle, normalized to have total measure `1`
* instances `measure_space`, `probability_measure` for the circle with respect to this measure
* for `n : ℤ`, `fourier n` is the monomial `λ z, z ^ n`, bundled as a continuous map from `circle`
  to `ℂ`

## Main statements

The theorem `orthonormal_fourier` states that the functions `fourier n`, when sent via
`continuous_map.to_Lp` to the L^2 space on the circle, form an orthonormal set.

## TODO

* Show that `submodule.span fourier` is dense in `C(circle, ℂ)`, i.e. that its
  `submodule.topological_closure` is `⊤`.  This follows from the Stone-Weierstrass theorem after
  checking that it is a subalgebra, closed under conjugation, and separates points.
* Show that the image of `submodule.span fourier` under `continuous_map.to_Lp` is dense in the
  `L^2` space on the circle, and thus that the functions `fourier` form a Hilbert basis.  This
  follows from the previous result using general theory on approximation by continuous functions.
