# Category of types with a omega complete partial order

In this file, we bundle the class `omega_complete_partial_order` into a
concrete category and prove that continuous functions also form
a `omega_complete_partial_order`.

## Main definitions

 * `ωCPO`
   * an instance of `category` and `concrete_category`
