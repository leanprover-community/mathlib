# Fraïssé Classes and Fraïssé Limits

This file pertains to the ages of countable first-order structures. The age of a structure is the
class of all finitely-generated structures that embed into it.

Of particular interest are Fraïssé classes, which are exactly the ages of countable
ultrahomogeneous structures. To each is associated a unique (up to nonunique isomorphism)
Fraïssé limit - the countable structure with that age.

## Main Definitions
* `first_order.language.age` is the class of finitely-generated structures that embed into a
particular structure.
* A class `K` has the `first_order.language.hereditary` when all finitely-generated
structures that embed into structures in `K` are also in `K`.
* A class `K` has the `first_order.language.joint_embedding` when for every `M`, `N` in
`K`, there is another structure in `K` into which both `M` and `N` embed.
* A class `K` has the `first_order.language.amalgamation` when for any pair of embeddings
of a structure `M` in `K` into other structures in `K`, those two structures can be embedded into a
fourth structure in `K` such that the resulting square of embeddings commutes.
* `first_order.language.is_fraisse` indicates that a class is nonempty, isomorphism-invariant,
essentially countable, and satisfies the hereditary, joint embedding, and amalgamation properties.

## Main Results
* We show that the age of any structure is isomorphism-invariant and satisfies the hereditary and
joint-embedding properties.
* `first_order.language.age.countable_quotient` shows that the age of any countable structure is
essentially countable.


## Implementation Notes
* Classes of structures are formalized with `set (bundled L.Structure)`.
* Some results pertain to countable limit structures, others to countably-generated limit
structures. In the case of a language with countably many function symbols, these are equivalent.

## TODO
* Define Fraïssé classes and limits
* Define ultrahomogeneous structures
* Show that any two Fraïssé limits of a Fraïssé class are isomorphic
* Show that any Fraïssé limit is ultrahomogeneous
* Show that the age of any ultrahomogeneous countable structure is Fraïssé
