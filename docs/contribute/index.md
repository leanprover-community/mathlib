# How to contribute to mathlib

Principally mathlib uses the fork-and-branch workflow. See
https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/
for a good introduction.

Here are some tips and tricks
to make the process of contributing as smooth as possible.

1. Use [Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) to
   discuss your contribution before and while you are working on it.
2. Adhere to the guidelines:
   - The [style guide](style.md) for contributors.
   - The explanation of [naming conventions](naming.md).
   - The [documentation guidelines](doc.md).
   - The [git commit conventions](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/doc/commit_convention.md).
3. Create a pull request from a feature branch on your personal fork,
   as explained in the link above, or from a branch of the main repository if you have commit access (you can ask for access on Zulip).
4. If you've made a lot of changes/additions, try to make many PRs containing small, self-contained pieces. This helps you get feedback as you go along, and it is much easier to review. This is especially important for new contributors.
5. You can use `leanproject get-cache` to fetch `.olean` binaries.
   ```
   leanproject get-cache
   git checkout -b my_new_feature
   ```
   - See [Caching compilation](#caching-compilation) for commands to automatically call `leanproject get-cache`.


## The nursery

Finally, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-nursery
makes it possible to have early access to work in progress.
See [its README](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-nursery/blob/master/README.md)
for more details.

## Caching compilation

In the `mathlib` git repository, you can run the following in a terminal:

```sh
sudo pip3 install mathlibtools
leanproject hooks
```

This will install the `leanproject` tool.  The call to `leanproject hooks`
sets up git hooks that will call cache the olean files when making a commit
and fetching the olean files when checking out a branch.
See the [mathlib-tools documentation](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/blob/master/README.md)
for more information.
