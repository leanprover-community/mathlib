# How to contribute to mathlib

Principally mathlib uses the fork-and-branch workflow. See
https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/
for a good introduction.

Here are some tips and tricks
to make the process of contributing as smooth as possible.

1. Use Zulip: https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#
   Discuss your contribution while you are working on it.
2. Adhere to the guidelines:
   - The [style guide](/docs/style.md) for contributors.
   - The explanation of [naming conventions](/docs/naming.md).
   - The [git commit conventions](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/commit_convention.md).
3. Create a pull request from a feature branch on your personal fork,
   as explained in the link above.


## The community fork and the nursery

The community also uses https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib
for collaborative contributions: ask on Zulip if you'd like commit access.

Finally, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-nursery
makes it possible to have early access to work in progress.
See [its README](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-nursery/blob/master/README.md)
for more details.
