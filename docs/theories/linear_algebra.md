# Maths in Lean : Linear algebra

The definitions of modules and vector fields are in `algebra/module`.
In `linear_algebra` are their products,
sub-objects, quotients, and morphisms. There are also (unordered) bases
and the definition of dimension of a vector space. But there is nothing specific to finite dimension and matrices yet.
