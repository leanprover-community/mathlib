# Maths in Lean : quotients and equivalenceÂ classes

A type with an equivalence relation on it is called a `setoid` in Lean.
Setoids are defined in `init/data/setoid.lean` and the quotient type
corresponding to the equivalence classes of the equivalence relation is
defined in `init/data/quot.lean` . The online document 
*Theorem Proving In Lean* has 
[quite a good section about setoids and quotients](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/axioms_and_computation.html#quotients)

TODO: find a nice equivalence relation in mathlib (quotient groups?
congruences mod n?) and give it as an example here.
