# Maths in Lean : polynomials

General purposes multivariate polynomials over rings are defined in
`linear_algebra/mv_polynomial.lean`. Univariate polynomials get a special
treatment in `data/polynomial`. Multivariate polynomial over `ℤ` 
get a special treatment with a view towards diophantine equations in
`number_theory/dioph`.
