# Hole commands

**This page is no longer maintained. For an up-to-date list of hole commands in mathlib, see the
[mathlib docs](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/hole_commands.html).**

Both VS Code and emacs support integration for 'hole commands'.

In VS Code, if you enter `{! !}`, a small light bulb symbol will appear, and
clicking on it gives a drop down menu of available hole commands. Running one
of these will replace the `{! !}` with whatever text that hole command provides.

In emacs, you can do something similar with `C-c SPC`.
