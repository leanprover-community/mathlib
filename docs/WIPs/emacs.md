# Using Emacs FAQ #

This is for people who can use VS Code and want to switch to using
emacs for editing Lean code.

Q) What are the keyboard shortcuts which are likely to help me?

A) Take a look at [the docs](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-mode/blob/master/README.md#key-bindings-and-commands) for emacs' lean-mode.

Q) In VS Code I sometimes click on that little icon consisting of four
white lines all the same size and on top of each other; then I can see all the
utputs for all the #check and #print commands and all the errors and everything.
How do I do that in emacs?

A) You might like C-c C-b (ctrl-C ctrl-B) (and then move your cursor to the
end of the file) and you might also like C-c ! l.

Q) In VS code I sometimes click on that little icon consisting of four
white lines which are all different sizes. Then I can see the output of the
command my cursor is on. How do I do that in emacs?

A) Emacs shows that automatically in the tiny line at the very bottom.
