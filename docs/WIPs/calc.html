<h1>How to use calc</h1>

<p><code>calc</code> appears to be something called an <code>environment</code>. I don't really
know what an environment is. </p>

<p>calc will work with any relation tagged [refl], and if they're also tagged
[trans] then calc is a bit more powerful.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a proof which uses <code>calc</code>. When I start it looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
open nat
theorem zero_add_induction_step (d : ℕ) (H : 0 + d = d) : 0 + succ d = succ d :=
calc 0 + succ d = _      : _
--- ABOVE HERE write more ... lines
...             = succ d : _
</code></p>

<p>When I have finished it looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
open nat
theorem zero_add_induction_step (d : ℕ) (H : 0 + d = d) : 0 + succ d = succ d :=
calc 0 + succ d = succ (0 + d) : rfl
...             = succ d : by rw [H]
</code></p>
