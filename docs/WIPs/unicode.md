# Unicode FAQ #

Q) Which unicode characters are in Lean and how can I work out the shortcuts
to get them?

A) If the unicode character is already on your VS Code screen, you can just hover over it. If not, you can always look through [this big list](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/5bfb016a0006255b7bb075cbfc973fd3e1c0add8/translations.json) of what you can type after the \ symbol (these work both in VS Code and emacs).

Q) Doesn't [this line](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/5bfb016a0006255b7bb075cbfc973fd3e1c0add8/translations.json#L2219) seem to say that I can enter the integers with "Bbb{Z}"?

A) Yeah. Don't ask me. Note that there are 4 other ways to input a blackboard bold Z.
