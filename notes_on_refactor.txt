Advantages of the bare function and typeclass approach:

1) if f is a ring hom and the lemma needs an add monoid hom
then you can get one with a coercion (f : R \to+ S) but
`⇑↑f` is not syntactically `⇑f` so rewrites can fail
(but erw might work)

2) If S is a subring but the lemma needs a submonoid
then the same sort of story. I

3) Even worse than (2) -- if S is a subring but is first
defined as an additive subgroup and then later on you prove
it's closed under multiplication then the promotion now
needs `S' : subring R`. Say S is an add_subgroup_closure
and `S'` is then the subring, and you're trying to prove
an inclusion of the set S' into another add_subgroup
you need to rewrite

TODO : find examples where this is happening.
