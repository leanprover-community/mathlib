Defines a category, as a typeclass parametrised by the type of objects.
Introduces notations
  `X ‚ü∂ Y` for the morphism spaces,
  `f ‚â´ g` for composition in the 'arrows' convention.

Users may like to add `f ‚äö g` for composition in the standard convention, using
```
local notation f ` ‚äö `:80 g:80 := category.comp g f    -- type as \oo
```

The propositional fields of `category` are annotated with the auto_param `obviously`, which is just a synonym for `skip`.
Actually, there is a tactic called `obviously` which is not part of this pull request, which should be used here. It successfully
discharges a great many of these goals. For now, proofs which could be provided entirely by `obviously` (and hence omitted entirely
and discharged by an auto_param), are all marked with a comment "-- obviously says:".

The typeclass `category C` describes morphisms associated to objects of type `C`.
The universe levels of the objects and morphisms are unconstrained, and will often need to be specified explicitly, as `category.{u v} C`. (See also `large_category` and `small_category`.)

A `large_category` has objects in one universe level higher than the universe level of the morphisms. 
It is useful for examples such as the category of types, or the category of groups, etc.
