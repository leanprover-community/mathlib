Defines a category, as a typeclass parametrised by the type of objects.
Introduces notations
  `X ‚ü∂ Y` for the morphism spaces,
  `f ‚â´ g` for composition in the 'arrows' convention.

Users may like to add `f ‚äö g` for composition in the standard convention, using
```
local notation f ` ‚äö `:80 g:80 := category.comp g f    -- type as \oo
```

The propositional fields of `category` are annotated with the auto_param `obviously`, which is just a synonym for `skip`.
Actually, there is a tactic called `obviously` which is not part of this pull request, which should be used here. It successfully
discharges a great many of these goals. For now, proofs which could be provided entirely by `obviously` (and hence omitted entirely
and discharged by an auto_param), are all marked with a comment "-- obviously says:".
