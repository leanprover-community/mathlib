The propositional fields of `category` are annotated with the auto_param `obviously`, which is just a synonym for `skip`.
Actually, there is a tactic called `obviously` which is not part of this pull request, which should be used here. It successfully
discharges a great many of these goals. For now, proofs which could be provided entirely by `obviously` (and hence omitted entirely
and discharged by an auto_param), are all marked with a comment "-- obviously says:".
